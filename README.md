Video Directory Screencap Preview Page Generator
================================================

Video Directory Screencap Preview Page Generator is a simple application that essentially presents a preview/entry/menu page for movie files located in the application directory.

Using Snatchit! to generate once-off thumbnail files, Video Directory Screencap Preview Page Generator presents a menu page linking directly to the video file that displays the file's name as well as some screen captures to the user. Note that although 9 thumbnails are generated, only images 2 - 8 are actually used by the menu.

A preview pane utilising Window Media Player components is also available on the menu.

A simple config.ini text file is used for some custom labels.

Note: Also, by adding a qualified folder path as an launch argument, Video Directory Screencap Preview Page Generator can also be used to display videos not held in its home directory.
